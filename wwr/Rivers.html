                <h1>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho </h1>
                <p1>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was
                    given
                    the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
                    number
                    of
                    folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never
                    left.
                </p1>
                <p></p>
                <p2> Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are
                    also
                    commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which tower
                    over
                    the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.</p2>
                <p></p>
                <p3>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
                    undammed
                    rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in
                    the
                    early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
                    summer...but
                    families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer
                    water
                    more.

                <h1>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h1>
                <p4>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river
                    flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert
                    scenery,
                    and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys
                    Rapid
                    (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations,
                    evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p4>
                <p></p>
                <p5>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days</p5>
                <p></p>
                <p6> Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This designation is based on the
                    uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p6>

                <h1>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h1>
                <p7>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will never forget
                    your visit to the Grand Canyon.</p7>
                <p></p>
                <p8>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one
                    truly
                    unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids,
                    but
                    with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.</p8>
                <p></p>
                <P9>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
                    technically
                    rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However,
                    most
                    people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</P9>
